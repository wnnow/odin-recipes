  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Chicken schnitzel is a breeze to make in the oven. Plus, this method uses less oil and has easier cleanup. The
    breaded
    chicken breasts are baked until golden and crispy on the outside, yet they're still tender and juicy on the inside.
    Serve schnitzels with lemon wedges and a German-style potato salad.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as desired</li>
    <li>6 chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise </li>(butterflied)
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>2 cups seasoned bread crumbs</li>
    <li>1 large lemon, zested</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and drizzle
      olive oil
      over foil. Place the baking sheet in the oven as it preheats.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound with
      the
      smooth side of a meat mallet to 1/4-inch thickness. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Mix flour and paprika together in a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs, salt, and pepper together in a second shallow
      bowl. Mix
      bread crumbs and lemon zest together in a third shallow bowl.</li>
    <li>Dredge one piece of chicken in flour; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back in
      the
      bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat both sides. Place the breaded chicken, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with
      remaining chicken.
    </li>
    <li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Arrange chicken in a single layer on the hot sheet. Drizzle more olive
      oil over
      each piece.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken and continue baking until no longer pink in the
      center and
      the breading is lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
      read
      at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
