  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is an easy casserole made with ground beef, cabbage, garlic, and tomatoes. My kids don't even like cabbage,
    but
    they love this dish! Serve with rice for a comforting weeknight dinner. Also, the longer it stands the better it
    tastes!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 small head cabbage, chopped</li>
    <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
